# Design `CardPreview` component

---

Difficulty: **Medium**

Tags: **HTML/CSS**

This challenge is mostly about design. You are asked to build a component named `CardPreview` which is located at `src/components/card`. We have already prepared a `styles.css` where you will put all the CSS stuffs for your markup.

The expected result should look like below, you should be able to see the result on [/cards](/cards)

All the assets you could use are located at `public/images/` and `public/icons`.

> For those one that are not familiar with `react`, don't worry! the only difference for this challenge is the way you set a `class` property to any html tag, just use `className` instead
> 
```html
- <div class="my-class"...
+ <div className="my-class"...
```
