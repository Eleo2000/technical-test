For this challenge, you have to write a basic redux implementation.

You can see a list of tech and a button under this page [/items](/items).

It is currently written like a simple component here `src/components/ItemList`.

What you have todo are:

> - Add and install `redux` into the project. eg: `yarn install redux`.
> - Implement the store, action and reducer.
> - Connect the `ItemList` component to redux.
> - Move and get the list of tech stack from the redux state.
> - Dispatch an action to add Javascript to the list of the item right after NodeJs.
