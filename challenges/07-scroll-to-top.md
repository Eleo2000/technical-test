For this challenge, you are inviting to finish the UI/UX of `Go To Top` button. As you may noticed, the button is not in the correct position and not working as expected. You have to implement the component following this rules:

> - The button should always be at the right bottom of the page
> - The button should be hidden and should only appear when we scroll for a certain height eg: ~200px
> - On clicking it, we should be smoothly taken to the top of the page

You can find the component named `ScrollToTopButton` and `styles.css`  here `src/components/scrollToTopButton`.
